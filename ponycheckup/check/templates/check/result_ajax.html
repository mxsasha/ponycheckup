                Your web server allows the TRACE method. This is not good, as it rarely serves a purpose,
                and can be used in cross-site scripting attacks.

        <p>The TRACE method is a rarely used HTTP request method. Basically, it asks the webserver
            to return the exact request as it was received. This can be used in cross-site scripting,
            to retrieve the session cookie. TRACE is intended for debugging, but very rarely used, so it's
            a good practice to disable it. You can always re-enable it later if you do need it.</p>
